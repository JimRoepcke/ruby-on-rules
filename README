Rules is a Ruby library that provides application developers
with an easy-to-use rule engine.  Rule-based development can
dramatically decrease the time it takes to develop a
sophisticated application, while at the same time increasing
the speed a development team can make simple and complicated
local or application-wide changes.

The design is based on Apple's WebObjects' Direct To Web
framework.

Rules is stuck at the pre-alpha stage of development. You
are encouraged to fork this repository and make
improvements.

Special thanks to TapKit for the qualifier module.
